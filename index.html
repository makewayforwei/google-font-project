            Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed for display. It comes in four weights (light, medium, bold, and black), as well as aesthetic variations, small capitals, and a plethora of different glyphs. Orbitron was created to provide graphic designers with an alternative to fonts like as Eurostile and Bank Gothic in the future. If you've ever watched a futuristic sci-fi film, you've probably observed that all other typefaces have been lost or destroyed in the cataclysm that forced mankind to evacuate the planet. Only a few geometric fonts have survived to be used on the exteriors of spaceships, spacestation signs, monopolistic corporate logos, uniforms with aerodynamic shoulder pads, and so on. Of course, Orbitron may be utilized on movie posters depicting this unavoidable future.
          </p>
          <p>
           Colophon Foundry created Space Mono, an innovative fixed-width font family for Google Design. It includes a Latin Extended glyph set, which allows for typesetting in English and other Western European languages. Designed for editorial use in headline and display typography, the letterforms incorporate a geometric foundation and grotesque details that are reminiscent of 1960s headline typefaces (See: Microgramma, Eurostile), many of which have since been adopted by science fiction films, television, and literature.

            Commissioner's voices are available in a variety of styles ranging from Thin to Black, as well as italics. The varying proportions of lowercase and caps lend warmth and appeal to texts of all sizes, while the different voices can communicate a variance in typographic texture that spans from delicate in tiny sizes to exuberant in larger ones.

            Imbue is a fresh twist on a concentrated Didone. Its characters are beautiful and distinctive, and most importantly, they can capture attention at both big and small scales. It was designed in the June/July 2016.

           Lexend Exa is a set of seven font families designed to improve reading skills. Lexend's families were designed utilizing Shaver-Troup Formulations, as prescription eyeglasses acquire competence for those with short-sightedness.

            Raph Levien produced the open-source typeface Inconsolata, a humanist monospaced typeface intended for source code listings, terminal emulators, and other similar applications. It was inspired by Lucas de Groot's proprietary Consolas monospaced typeface, the proportional Avenir, and IBM's iconic monospaced Letter Gothic.

Initially lacking a bold weight, Inconsolata was completely hinted and a bold variation was added when it was introduced to Google Fonts.
